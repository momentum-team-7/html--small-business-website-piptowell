        Wild hyacinth: This bulbflower naturalizes well in gardens. 
        The bulb grows best in well-drained soil high in humus. 
        It will grow in lightly shaded forest areas and on rocky outcrops 
        as well as in open meadows or prairies. 
        Additionally it is found growing alongside streams and rivers. 
        The plants may be divided in autumn after the leaves have withered. 
        Bulbs should be planted in the autumn. 
        Additionally the plant spreads by seed rather than by runners.

        <br>
        Lily-of-the-Valley: With its deeply fragrant flowers -- scallop-edge 
        bells that dangle above bright emerald-green leaves -- this nearly 
        deer-proof shade lover appears to be delicate in an old-fashioned way. 
        But the pretty plant is also an intrepid wanderer, spreading readily 
        and rapidly, and anyone who gardens in a small space will want to watch 
        this perennial to make sure it stays in bounds. 
        Tolerates shade well. <b>Warning: this plant is poisonous.</b>
